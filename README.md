A Front-end Design Challenge for Eldest Daughter

## Getting started
1. Clone this repo locally.
2. Fire off local server using 
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
3. Navigate to `localhost:8000`

_All dependencies (only one at this point) are included in the repo under the vendor profile._
- Modernizr.JS: For improved cross-browser support

_Further optimization can be had by minimizing all html, css and js files._

### Logging In
Obviously this is just a front-end challenge, so I only added basic HTML5 validations using `required` and Javascript validations alerting whether username and password are correct.

**Username** = `username`/
**Password** = `password`

### Mobile
I developed this using [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me) with my iPhone5 and an iPhone4s (the only things I had readily on hand). Beyond that I used the latest versions of all major browsers and used fallbacks and vendor prefixes where needed. Modernizr should assist back to IE8.
